# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This single-page application (SPA) is built using React, Vite, and plain CSS, showcasing my skills, projects, and experience. Below you'll find a brief overview of the sections and features included in this project.

## Overview

This portfolio is divided into five main sections:

1. **Home**
2. **About**
3. **Projects**
4. **Contact**
5. **Footer**

### Home

- **Introduction**: Includes a large "Hello, I am Hamada" heading. Below it, there is an animated section displaying a series of phrases, with one new phrase appearing every 2 seconds.
- **Contact Button**: A smooth scroll button that takes the visitor directly to the Contact section.

### About

- **Tech Stack Carousel**: A Swiper carousel displaying logos of the technologies I have studied, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Git, GitHub, Node.js, Express.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and VSCode. The carousel loops and auto-plays, and users can interact with it by dragging the logos.
